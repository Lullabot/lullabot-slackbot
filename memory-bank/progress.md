# Progress: Lullabot Slack Bot

## What Works (Based on Code Analysis)
- Core bot application structure (`src/bot.ts`) using Slack Bolt.
- Dynamic plugin loading system from `src/plugins/`.
- Environment variable configuration (`dotenv`).
- TypeScript compilation and development scripts (`package.json`).
- Pattern Registry for cross-plugin command management (`src/services/pattern-registry.ts`)
- Enhanced plugins with recent improvements:
    - **Conversions** (comprehensive unit conversion support with explicit target units and thread handling)
    - **Help** (now with dynamic bot names, updated factoid help text, and refactored helper functions)
    - **Factoids** (with link preview control and improved pattern matching)
    - **Karma** (with improved thread handling)
    - **Greetings** (hello.ts)
    - **Uptime**
    - **Botsnack**

## Recently Completed
- **Issue #117: Unit Conversion Specific Target Units (August 2025)**
  - Fixed core issue where `convert 5k to in` returned miles instead of requested inches
  - Added support for explicit target units in both `convert X to Y` and `what is X in Y?` formats
  - Implemented comprehensive backward compatibility for existing `convert X` auto-opposite behavior
  - Fixed app mention handler questionMatch bug identified by GitHub Copilot code review
  - Added proper thread handling so conversion responses maintain conversation context
  - Comprehensive test coverage with 33 tests including edge cases and threading scenarios
- **Conversions Plugin Refactoring (August 2025)**
  - Major code quality improvements eliminating ~45 lines of duplicate code
  - Created reusable helper functions: `handleConvertCommand()`, `sendConversionsWithTarget()`, `sendConversionResponse()`
  - Improved maintainability with centralized logic and single responsibility principle
  - Enhanced error handling with graceful fallbacks for invalid target units
  - Established threading pattern consistent with other plugins
- **Issue #38: Dynamic Bot Names in Help Text (January 2025)**
  - Updated help system to display actual bot name instead of hardcoded `@bot` placeholders
  - Users can now copy/paste help commands directly without manual bot name replacement
  - Implemented using `client.auth.test()` pattern for dynamic bot user ID fetching
  - Graceful error handling with fallback to `@bot` on API failures
- **Help Plugin Refactoring (January 2025)**
  - Major code quality improvements following software engineering best practices
  - Created reusable helper functions: `replaceBotMentions()`, `getBotUserId()`, `processHelpRequest()`
  - Eliminated 26+ lines of code duplication across event handlers
  - Improved maintainability with single responsibility principle and pure functions
  - Enhanced error handling and testability
- Added link preview control for factoids (May 2025)
  - New syntax: `@bot X is Y | preview` or `@bot X is Y | nopreview`
  - Visual indicators in factoid listing (lock emoji for disabled previews)
- Improved factoid pattern matching and filtering (April 2025)
- Fixed issues with user mentions in factoid triggers
- Added comprehensive test cases for factoids plugin
- Enhanced message threading support in plugins
- Improved factoid list display to reduce visual clutter

## Current Status
- Active development with regular improvements and code quality focus
- Recent major enhancement of unit conversion functionality with Issue #117 resolution
- Established patterns for helper function refactoring and thread handling standardization
- Integration with automated code review tools for continuous quality improvement
- Several dependency updates pending in open PRs

## Test Coverage Status
- **Conversions Plugin**: 33 comprehensive tests covering all functionality including threading
- **Help Plugin**: Enhanced test coverage with helper function validation
- **Factoids Plugin**: Comprehensive test coverage for pattern matching and functionality
- **Overall**: Strong focus on test-driven development and regression prevention

## Code Quality Achievements
- **Helper Function Pattern**: Established across multiple plugins for code reuse
- **Thread Handling**: Standardized pattern implemented consistently
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation and user-friendly error messages
- **Test Coverage**: Comprehensive testing including edge cases and threading scenarios
- **Code Review Integration**: Active use of automated tools like GitHub Copilot for quality assurance

## Known Issues/Risks
- **Data Storage Scalability:** File-based JSON storage might become slow or unwieldy with very large datasets or high concurrency.
- **Error Handling:** Continuous improvements to error handling within plugins.
- **Testing Coverage:** Test files are being expanded across all plugins following conversions plugin example.
