# Progress: Lullabot Slack Bot

## What Works (Based on README & Code Scan)
- Core bot application structure (`src/bot.ts`) using Slack Bolt.
- Dynamic plugin loading system from `src/plugins/`.
- Environment variable configuration (`dotenv`).
- TypeScript compilation and development scripts (`package.json`).
- Existing plugins (as listed in README):
    - Help
    - Factoids
    - Karma
    - Greetings (hello.ts)
    - Uptime
    - Botsnack

## What's Left to Build
- N/A (Initial analysis phase - no active build tasks defined yet)

## Current Status
- Project structure analyzed.
- Core dependencies and patterns identified.
- Existing plugin functionality documented at a high level based on README.

## Known Issues/Risks
- **Data Storage Scalability:** File-based JSON storage might become slow or unwieldy with very large datasets or high concurrency.
- **Error Handling:** Detailed error handling within plugins needs closer examination. `bot.ts` has basic plugin load error handling.
- **Testing Coverage:** Test files exist (`src/plugins/__tests__`), but overall coverage is unknown.
