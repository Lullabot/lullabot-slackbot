# Progress: Lullabot Slack Bot

## What Works (Based on Code Analysis)
- Core bot application structure (`src/bot.ts`) using Slack Bolt.
- Dynamic plugin loading system from `src/plugins/`.
- Environment variable configuration (`dotenv`).
- TypeScript compilation and development scripts (`package.json`).
- Pattern Registry for cross-plugin command management (`src/services/pattern-registry.ts`)
- Enhanced plugins with recent improvements:
    - Help (now with updated factoid help text for preview settings)
    - Factoids (with link preview control and improved pattern matching)
    - Karma (with improved thread handling)
    - Greetings (hello.ts)
    - Uptime
    - Botsnack

## Recently Completed
- Added link preview control for factoids (May 2025)
  - New syntax: `@bot X is Y | preview` or `@bot X is Y | nopreview`
  - Visual indicators in factoid listing (lock emoji for disabled previews)
- Improved factoid pattern matching and filtering (April 2025)
- Fixed issues with user mentions in factoid triggers
- Added comprehensive test cases for factoids plugin
- Enhanced message threading support in plugins
- Improved factoid list display to reduce visual clutter

## Current Status
- Active development with regular improvements
- Recent focus on factoid functionality and user experience
- Several dependency updates pending in open PRs

## Known Issues/Risks
- **Data Storage Scalability:** File-based JSON storage might become slow or unwieldy with very large datasets or high concurrency.
- **Error Handling:** Continuous improvements to error handling within plugins.
- **Testing Coverage:** Test files are being expanded, especially for factoid plugin.
