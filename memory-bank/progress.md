# Progress: Lullabot Slack Bot

## What Works (Based on Code Analysis)
- Core bot application structure (`src/bot.ts`) using Slack Bolt.
- Dynamic plugin loading system from `src/plugins/`.
- Environment variable configuration (`dotenv`).
- TypeScript compilation and development scripts (`package.json`).
- Pattern Registry for cross-plugin command management (`src/services/pattern-registry.ts`)
- Enhanced plugins with recent improvements:
    - Help (now with dynamic bot names, updated factoid help text, and refactored helper functions)
    - Factoids (with link preview control and improved pattern matching)
    - Karma (with improved thread handling)
    - Greetings (hello.ts)
    - Uptime
    - Botsnack

## Recently Completed
- **Issue #38: Dynamic Bot Names in Help Text (January 2025)**
  - Updated help system to display actual bot name instead of hardcoded `@bot` placeholders
  - Users can now copy/paste help commands directly without manual bot name replacement
  - Implemented using `client.auth.test()` pattern for dynamic bot user ID fetching
  - Graceful error handling with fallback to `@bot` on API failures
- **Help Plugin Refactoring (January 2025)**
  - Major code quality improvements following software engineering best practices
  - Created reusable helper functions: `replaceBotMentions()`, `getBotUserId()`, `processHelpRequest()`
  - Eliminated 26+ lines of code duplication across event handlers
  - Improved maintainability with single responsibility principle and pure functions
  - Enhanced error handling and testability
- Added link preview control for factoids (May 2025)
  - New syntax: `@bot X is Y | preview` or `@bot X is Y | nopreview`
  - Visual indicators in factoid listing (lock emoji for disabled previews)
- Improved factoid pattern matching and filtering (April 2025)
- Fixed issues with user mentions in factoid triggers
- Added comprehensive test cases for factoids plugin
- Enhanced message threading support in plugins
- Improved factoid list display to reduce visual clutter

## Current Status
- Active development with regular improvements
- Recent focus on factoid functionality and user experience
- Several dependency updates pending in open PRs

## Known Issues/Risks
- **Data Storage Scalability:** File-based JSON storage might become slow or unwieldy with very large datasets or high concurrency.
- **Error Handling:** Continuous improvements to error handling within plugins.
- **Testing Coverage:** Test files are being expanded, especially for factoid plugin.
