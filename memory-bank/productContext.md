# Product Context: Lullabot Slack Bot

## Problem Solved
Provides automated utilities, information retrieval (factoids), and community engagement features (karma) within the Lullabot Slack workspace, reducing repetitive questions and adding useful/fun interactions.

## Intended Workflow
- Users interact with the bot via direct messages, mentions (`@bot`), or specific message patterns (e.g., `keyword?`, `item++`).
- The bot listens for these triggers and responds accordingly, often in threads to keep channels clean.
- New functionalities are added as self-contained plugins.

## User Experience Goals
- **Responsive:** The bot should react quickly to commands.
- **Helpful:** Provide clear information and perform utility tasks effectively.
- **Organized:** Use threads for detailed responses to avoid cluttering main channels.
- **Extensible:** Easily add new commands and features through the plugin system.
