# Active Context: Lullabot Slack Bot

## Current Focus
Initial project analysis and Memory Bank population. Understanding the existing structure, plugins, and core mechanisms.

## Recent Changes
- N/A (Initial analysis)

## Next Steps
- Review this proposed Memory Bank content with the user.
- Based on feedback, proceed with specific development tasks or further analysis as directed.

## Active Decisions/Considerations
- Confirm the exact location and creation mechanism of the `data/` directory for JSON storage. The README mentions it, but its creation isn't explicit in `bot.ts`. It's likely handled within plugins needing persistence.
- Understand the implementation details of the file-based storage (`src/services/storage.ts` might exist, or it's inline in plugins).
