# Active Context: Lullabot Slack Bot

## Current Focus
Link preview management for factoids and general bot improvements.

## Recent Changes
- Added link preview control for factoids (PR #77, fixes #76)
- Enhanced factoid filtering logic and regex patterns for improved accuracy
- Improved thread handling in karma plugin
- Added memory bank for better documentation
- Updated dependencies (Node.js, TypeScript, etc.)
- Fixed various factoid matching patterns to address edge cases

## Next Steps
- Merge pending dependency updates (several PRs open)
- Potential improvements to other plugins based on recent factoid enhancements
- Continue improving plugin architecture with pattern registry

## Active Decisions/Considerations
- Factoid link previews are enabled by default, with a clean interface to disable them
- Factoid listing now shows eye emoji (üëÅÔ∏è) only for factoids with links that have previews enabled
- User experience improvements focus on more reliable message handling
