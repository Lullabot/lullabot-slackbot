# Active Context: Lullabot Slack Bot

## Current Focus
Recently completed Issue #38 (dynamic bot names in help text) and follow-up code quality improvements through refactoring.

## Recent Changes
- **Issue #38 Completed (January 2025):** Updated help system to display actual bot name instead of hardcoded `@bot` placeholders
  - Help text now shows the real bot name (e.g., `@tugbot` instead of `@bot`) for better copy/paste usability
  - Implemented dynamic bot name fetching using `client.auth.test()` pattern from uptime plugin
  - All help commands now display contextually correct bot mentions
- **Help Plugin Refactoring (January 2025):** Major code quality improvements following best practices
  - Created helper functions to eliminate code duplication (26+ lines reduced)
  - Added `replaceBotMentions()`, `getBotUserId()`, and `processHelpRequest()` helpers
  - Improved error handling with graceful API failure handling
  - Enhanced maintainability with single responsibility principle
- Added link preview control for factoids (PR #77, fixes #76) 
- Enhanced factoid filtering logic and regex patterns for improved accuracy
- Improved thread handling in karma plugin
- Added memory bank for better documentation
- Updated dependencies (Node.js, TypeScript, etc.)

## Next Steps
- Merge pending dependency updates (several PRs open)
- Consider applying similar refactoring patterns to other plugins
- Continue improving plugin architecture with pattern registry
- Potential creation of more helper utilities based on learned patterns

## Active Decisions/Considerations
- **Help System Architecture:** Chose to maintain separation of concerns rather than combining bot ID fetching with string manipulation
- **Pure Functions Preferred:** Helper functions designed as pure functions for better testability and maintainability
- **Error Handling Strategy:** Network failures gracefully degrade to `@bot` fallback text
- Factoid link previews are enabled by default, with a clean interface to disable them
- User experience improvements focus on more reliable message handling and cleaner display
