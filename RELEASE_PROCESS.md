# Release Process

This document outlines the release process for the Lullabot Slackbot project.

## Versioning Strategy

We follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) (SemVer):
- **MAJOR** version (X.0.0): Incompatible API changes or major architectural changes
- **MINOR** version (0.X.0): New functionality in a backwards compatible manner
- **PATCH** version (0.0.X): Backwards compatible bug fixes

## Release Schedule

- **Patch releases**: As needed for critical bug fixes
- **Minor releases**: When new features are ready (typically monthly)
- **Major releases**: Only when breaking changes are necessary

## Release Process

### 1. Pre-Release Checklist

Before creating a release, ensure:

- [ ] All tests pass: `npm test`
- [ ] Build completes without errors: `npm run build`
- [ ] Security audit passes: `npm audit --production`
- [ ] All PRs for the release are merged to `main`
- [ ] CHANGELOG.md is updated with all changes

### 2. Create Release

#### Using GitHub CLI (Recommended)

```bash
# Ensure you're on main branch and up to date
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Determine version number (check CHANGELOG.md and previous tags)
VERSION="v1.0.0"  # Replace with actual version

# Create and push tag
git tag -a $VERSION -m "Release $VERSION"
git push origin $VERSION

# Create GitHub release with changelog
gh release create $VERSION \
  --title "Release $VERSION" \
  --notes-file CHANGELOG.md \
  --target main
```

#### Using GitHub Web Interface

1. Go to [Releases page](https://github.com/Lullabot/lullabot-slackbot/releases)
2. Click "Draft a new release"
3. Click "Choose a tag" and create new tag (e.g., `v1.0.0`)
4. Set release title: "Release v1.0.0"
5. Copy relevant section from CHANGELOG.md to release description
6. Click "Publish release"

### 3. Post-Release Tasks

After creating the release:

1. **Deploy to Production**
   - The Docker image will automatically build and deploy via the production workflow
   - Monitor the deployment in Slack to ensure the bot comes back online

2. **Verify Deployment**
   ```bash
   # Check bot status in Slack
   # Type in any channel: @bot uptime
   ```

3. **Announce Release**
   - Post in #general or #tech channel about the new release
   - Include highlights of new features or important fixes

## Changelog Management

   - Tools: `standard-version` or `semantic-release`

2. **Automated Version Bumping**
   ```json
   {
     "scripts": {
       "release:patch": "npm version patch && git push --follow-tags",
       "release:minor": "npm version minor && git push --follow-tags",
       "release:major": "npm version major && git push --follow-tags"
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Release Workflow** (GitHub Actions)
   - Automatically create releases when tags are pushed
   - Run tests and build before allowing release
   - Auto-deploy to production on release
